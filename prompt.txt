You are a coding agent working in my Next.js App Router repo.

Goal (ONE step): Add local MDX content support for:
- /blog (index) and /blog/[slug]
- /projects (index) and /projects/[slug]
Content should live in the repo as .mdx files and support headings, links, images, code blocks.

Requirements:
- Use official Next.js MDX support with App Router.
- Add mdx-components.tsx (required by Next.js) so we can style and map elements (especially images).
- Use frontmatter for metadata (title, date, summary, tags). Parse it via gray-matter.
- Keep rendering server-side (no client runtime for MDX).
- Do not add code highlighting yet (we’ll do rehype-pretty-code later).

1) Install deps
- Add: @next/mdx, gray-matter
- (If Next.js requires additional MDX-related packages per docs, add them.)

2) Configure MDX
- Update next.config.ts to enable MDX for .mdx files (App Router compatible).
- Ensure pageExtensions includes ts/tsx/mdx if needed.

3) Add MDX components mapping
- Create mdx-components.tsx in the correct location for this repo (per Next.js convention).
- Map:
  - a -> styled link
  - pre/code -> keep default prose styling
  - img -> use next/image (with width/height defaults) OR a simple wrapper that uses <img> safely for now.
  Keep it minimal and consistent with the current prose prose-invert styling.

4) Create content folders + sample content
- Create:
  - content/blog/hello-world.mdx
  - content/projects/personal-site.mdx
Each should include frontmatter:
  ---
  title: "..."
  date: "2026-02-01"
  summary: "..."
  tags: ["nextjs", "mdx"]
  ---
And body content with:
  - h1/h2
  - a code block
  - a link
  - an image reference (use /public/... and add a placeholder image file if needed)

5) Build a small content loader
- Create src/lib/content.ts with functions:
  - getAllBlogPosts(): returns metadata list sorted by date desc (slug + title/date/summary/tags)
  - getBlogPostBySlug(slug): returns { meta, Content } where Content is the compiled MDX component
  - getAllProjects(): same
  - getProjectBySlug(slug): same
Implementation notes:
  - Read files from content/blog and content/projects using fs/promises.
  - Parse frontmatter using gray-matter.
  - For MDX compilation/rendering in App Router, follow the official Next.js MDX approach (import .mdx or compile based on their guide).
  - Add generateStaticParams in [slug] pages so routes are static.

6) Implement routes
- Update:
  - src/app/blog/page.tsx (list posts)
  - src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (render post)
  - src/app/projects/page.tsx (list projects)
  - src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (render project)
Each page should use existing layout and render content inside:
  <article className="prose prose-invert max-w-none"> ... </article>

7) Confirm working
- npm run dev should work
- Visiting /blog shows list
- Clicking a post opens /blog/hello-world
- Visiting /projects shows list
- Clicking opens /projects/personal-site

Keep changes clean, minimal, and scalable.
After implementing, output a concise summary of files created/edited.
