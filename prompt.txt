Goal: Build the portfolio homepage (like the reference) using MDX frontmatter as the single source of truth.

Context:
- MDX is already set up (App Router).
- content/projects/*.mdx and content/blog/*.mdx exist.
- gray-matter is available.
- Typography styling is good.

Scope (ONLY this step):
- Build Home sections + Project cards + Skills tags.
- Use frontmatter fields in project MDX files to drive UI.
- Do NOT add code highlighting yet.
- Do NOT add shadcn/ui yet.

1) Define project frontmatter shape (standardize it)
Update (or create) a few sample project MDX files under content/projects:
Each must include frontmatter fields:
---
title: "Personal Site"
date: "2026-02-01"
summary: "Minimal personal site with MDX blog and project writeups."
status: "Live" # one of: Live | WIP | Paused
tech: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind"]
links:
  live: "https://example.com"
  code: "https://github.com/you/repo"
featured: true
---
Body can be short for now.

Create at least 3 project mdx files so we can render a grid.

2) Create content config for profile + skills (NOT in MDX)
Create: src/content/profile.ts
Export:
- profile: { name, handle, headline, availableForWork: boolean }
- socials: array of { label, href } (email, github, linkedin, twitter, etc.)
- skills: string[] (skills & tools tags)

3) Extend the existing content loader to return typed project metadata
Update src/lib/content.ts (or create helpers inside it) to:
- getAllProjects(): returns array of:
  { slug, title, date, summary, status, tech, links, featured }
  sorted by date desc.
- getFeaturedProjects(): filters featured === true (limit 4 by default)

Important:
- Validate required fields; if missing, throw a clear error with filename.
- Keep functions server-safe (fs/promises usage).

4) Build minimal reusable UI components (Tailwind only)
Create:
- src/components/Section.tsx
  - props: title, children
  - renders title as h2 and a divider spacing
- src/components/Tag.tsx
  - simple pill tag style like reference
- src/components/StatusBadge.tsx
  - shows Live/WIP/Paused with subtle styles
- src/components/ProjectCard.tsx
  - shows title, status badge, summary, tech tags
  - bottom row: Live + Code buttons/links (only if present)
  - whole card clickable to /projects/[slug] (optional), but keep explicit link buttons too

Keep design minimal and consistent with current dark theme.

5) Update pages
A) src/app/page.tsx (Home)
Render sections in order:
- Availability line (green dot + "Available for work" if profile.availableForWork)
- Profile panel (name + handle + socials)
- Short intro paragraph (headline)
- Skills & Tools section: render skills as <Tag />
- Proof-of-Work section:
  - render featured projects in a 2-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile
  - add a “Load more” button that expands to show all projects:
    - implement this ONLY as a tiny client component under src/components/ProjectGrid.tsx
    - default show 4, on click show all
- Reach out section: show socials

B) src/app/projects/page.tsx
- Render all projects in the same grid (no load more).

C) Keep blog pages unchanged for now.

6) Ensure all pages keep the “markdown/prose” feel
- Use prose only for rich text areas.
- For card grids and tag rows, use normal Tailwind (not inside prose), otherwise prose styles will fight layout.

7) Confirm:
- npm run dev works
- Home looks like a real portfolio page
- /projects lists all projects
- /projects/[slug] still renders MDX body

Deliverables:
- components added
- profile content file added
- project mdx files updated/added
- content loader updated with typed metadata
